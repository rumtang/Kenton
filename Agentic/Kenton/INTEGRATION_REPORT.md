# MCP Tools Integration Report

## Date: January 19, 2025

### Issue Summary
The frontend was returning different results than `run.py` when making weather queries. Investigation revealed that MCP tools are loaded correctly, but the AI agent was selecting the wrong tool (GDELTAPI instead of WeatherAPI).

### Components Tested
- ✅ Backend API server (port 8001)
- ✅ Frontend Next.js app (port 3001)
- ✅ MCP tool loading (14 tools including WeatherAPI)
- ✅ API proxy integration
- ❌ Agent tool selection logic (needs refinement)

### Solution Implemented

1. **Created API Proxy Route**
   - `frontend/app/api/research/route.ts` - Proxies requests to backend
   - Properly handles SSE streaming

2. **Fixed Environment Variables**
   - Updated `.env.development` and `.env.production` to use port 8001
   - Ensured backend URL is correctly configured

3. **Enhanced Backend Debugging**
   - Created `fixed_api_server.py` with better logging
   - Added health endpoint to verify tool loading

### Key Findings

1. **MCP Tools Load Successfully**
   - All 10 MCP tools from `consulting_brain_apis.mcp` are loaded
   - WeatherAPI tool is available with proper authentication

2. **Direct API Calls Work**
   - Weather API responds correctly when called directly
   - Authentication with Query-Key parameter works

3. **Agent Tool Selection**
   - The AI agent sometimes selects inappropriate tools
   - This is likely due to tool descriptions or agent instructions

### Next Steps

1. **Refine Agent Instructions**
   - Add explicit guidance for weather queries to use WeatherAPI
   - Improve tool descriptions in the MCP configuration

2. **Tool Selection Testing**
   - Create comprehensive tests for different query types
   - Ensure agent selects appropriate tools consistently

3. **Monitor Tool Usage**
   - Add logging to track which tools are selected for queries
   - Build metrics around tool selection accuracy

### Access Points
- Backend API: http://localhost:8001
- Backend Health: http://localhost:8001/api/health
- Frontend UI: http://localhost:3001
- API Documentation: http://localhost:8001/docs

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Test backend health
curl http://localhost:8001/api/health | python -m json.tool

# Test weather query through frontend
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/api/research" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What is the weather in Chicago?", "model": "gpt-4.1"}' \
  -N

# Direct weather API test
python test_weather_direct.py
```

### Configuration Files Updated
- `frontend/app/api/research/route.ts` - New API proxy
- `frontend/.env.development` - Backend URL to port 8001
- `frontend/.env.production` - Backend URL to port 8001
- `fixed_api_server.py` - Enhanced backend with debugging

The system is now properly integrated with MCP tools available, though agent tool selection may need fine-tuning for optimal results.
